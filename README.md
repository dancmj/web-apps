web-apps
========
Some web apps I make on my free time.
Current apps include:
* **[Life Counter](https://github.com/dancmj/web-apps/tree/master/lifecounter)**: Simple counter made with JQuery for use with Magic the Gathering, based on an [old reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1noiua/simple_life_counter_no_app_just_a_web_page_that/). It's very simple at the moment, maybe I'll expand it later.
* **[g.raffe](https://github.com/dancmj/g.raffe)**: A graph theory visualization tool able to run certain search algorithms. Algorithms and data structures are made with javascript and data visualization with [D3.js](http://d3js.org/).
* **[Hackernation-app](https://github.com/dancmj/hackernation)**: A webapp using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). The purpose of this platform is to create, share, discuss and solve any kind of math & computer science problems.
