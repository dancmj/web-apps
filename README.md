web-apps
========
Some web apps I make on my free time.
Current apps include:
* **Life Counter**: Simple counter made with JQuery for use with Magic the Gathering, based on an [old reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1noiua/simple_life_counter_no_app_just_a_web_page_that/). It's very simple at the moment, maybe I'll expand it later.
* **Graph Visualizer**: A graph theory visualization tool able to run certain search algorithms. Algorithms and data structures are made with pure javascript and data visualization with [D3.js](http://d3js.org/).
